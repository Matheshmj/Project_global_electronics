# Global Electronics - Data Analytics Project
## Problem Statement
As part of the Global Electronics data analytics team, the goal is to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover valuable insights from the companyâ€™s data. The aim is to provide actionable recommendations that enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive overall business growth.

## Business Use Cases
By analyzing customer, product, sales, and store data, this project focuses on:

- Enhancing marketing strategies based on customer insights.
- Optimizing inventory management by analyzing product demand.
- Improving sales forecasting and planning store expansions.
- Leveraging currency exchange rates to refine international pricing strategies.
## Tools Used
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis.
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning and EDA.
- MySQL for storing and retrieving cleaned data.
- Power BI for data visualization.
## Data Sources

## Datasets:
- Customer data (Customers.csv): Demographic details such as gender, D.O.B, and location.
- Sales data (Sales.csv): Transaction details, including product quantities, dates, and store IDs.
- Products data (Products.csv): Product information including categories, unit prices, and costs.
- Stores data (Stores.csv): Store locations, operational attributes, and sales performance.
- Currency exchange rates data (Exchange_Rates.csv): Historical exchange rates for financial analysis.
## Approach
### Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Handling missing values and converting data types (e.g., dates, numerical values).
- Merging datasets where necessary for analysis (e.g., linking sales data with product and customer data).
### Data Loading
- Inserting cleaned data into a MySQL database by creating relevant tables for each dataset.
### Power BI Visualization
- Connecting SQL to Power BI, importing the data, and creating interactive dashboards.
### SQL Queries and Calculations
- Formulating SQL queries to extract insights and perform calculations in Power BI.
## Analysis Steps
### Customer Analysis
- Demographic Distribution: Analyze gender, age, and location.
- Purchase Patterns: Frequency of purchases, preferred products, and customer behavior.
- Segmentation: Segment customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior.
### Sales Analysis
- Sales by Product and Store: Evaluate top-selling products and store performance.
- Order Volume Trends: Examine sales history over time (month and year).
### Product Analysis
- Product Popularity: Identify top-selling products and categories.
- Profitability: Compare unit cost and unit price for profitability analysis.
### Store Analysis
- Store Performance: Evaluate store performance based on sales and operational data.
- Geographical Analysis: Analyze sales by store location to identify top-performing regions.
## Findings and Recommendations
### Customer Demographics
- Balanced gender distribution: Products appeal equally to both men and women.
- Older customer base: Most customers are aged 60 and above, with fewer younger customers.
- Regional dominance: North America is the largest customer base, especially cities like Toronto, Montreal, and Atlanta.
### Product and Sales Insights
- Universal product appeal: Products like computers, cell phones, and entertainment content are popular across all demographics.
- Top brands: Contoso leads the market, followed by Wide World Importers and Adventure Works.
- Top products: Desktop computers, particularly from the "Adventure Works Desktop" and "WWI Desktop" series, are bestsellers.
### Sales and Delivery Trends
- Seasonal trends: Sales peak in December and decline in April annually.
- Growth trend: Sales saw an upward trend from 2017 to 2020, with a slight dip after April 2020.
## Conclusion
- The analysis provides insights that can guide Global Electronics in refining their marketing strategies, improving product offerings, and optimizing store operations. Addressing the preferences of a diverse customer base and considering currency exchange impacts can further drive business growth.
